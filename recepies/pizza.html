        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. 
                Let stand until yeast softens and begins 
                to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Combine flour and salt together in 
                the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with 
                a dough hook attachment. 
                Pour in yeast mixture. 
                Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. 
                Form dough into a tight ball and lightly 
                grease the top. Place in the bowl; cover loosely 
                with plastic wrap. Let rise until 
                doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Mix crushed tomatoes and pizza sauce 
                together in a bowl to make sauce.</li><br>
            <li>Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch 
                baking sheet generously with olive oil. 
                Press dough into the bottom. 
                Prick dough all over with a fork.<br><br> 
                Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over 
                dough; cover with 1 cup sauce. 
                Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. 
                Drizzle remaining olive oil over pizza.</li><br>
            <li>Let pizza rise in a warm area 
                until puffy, about 1 hour.</li><br>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees 
                F (230 degrees C).</li><br>
            <li>Bake pizza on the center rack of the preheated 
                oven until edges are very dark brown but top is not burnt, 
                15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the 
                pan for 5 minutes before slicing into squares.
            </li><br>
